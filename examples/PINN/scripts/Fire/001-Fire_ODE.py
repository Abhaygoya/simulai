Simple model of flame growth
Consider the scenario where you ignite a match, leading to the formation of a fiery ball 
that swiftly increases in size until it hits a certain threshold. Once it reaches this 
critical point, the ball of flame stabilizes, as the oxygen consumed by the combustion 
inside the ball equals the amount of oxygen available through the surface.
 
A simplified model of this phenomenon can be described as follows:
    du/dt = u**2 âˆ’ u**3

The given problem involves u, which denotes the radius of the fiery sphere with respect to 
the critical radius. 

The terms u^2 and u^3 arise from the surface area and volume of the sphere, respectively. 
The problem can be solved over a duration of time that is inversely proportional to u0.
